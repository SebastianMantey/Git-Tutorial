# Git Tutorial
This repo contains the code for my tutorial on Git. In the tutorial, we create a command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can watch the video series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nd8I5EYaGs&list=PLPOTBrypY74zUKmC-atRT75ulSrwj8UYS). Or you can read the text-based version on my [website](https://www.sebastian-mantey.com/posts/git-tutorial-with-python-p1-key-concepts).

PS: Compared to the actual tutorial, I made one extra commit to create this README.

# Credits
The code for the game is based on Sentdexâ€™ [Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln). I adjusted it somewhat, though, to suit my purposes.
